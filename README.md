# Dighum150c

This is my final project for Berkeley's Dighum150c, or computational literary analysis. My project specifically looks at the use of color between Wilkie Collins' *The Moonstone* and Katherine Mansfield's "The Garden Party and Other Stories". All the used files are found in this repository!
